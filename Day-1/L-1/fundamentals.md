# The Basics of Angular

## What is Angular?
- Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google.

## Why Angular?
- Angular is a full-featured framework for building complex single-page applications.
- It has a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) that makes it easy to create and manage projects.
- It uses two-way data binding, which makes it easy to keep data in sync between the view and the model.
- It has a built-in dependency injection(Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a way to automatically provide services to components, instead of manually creating them.) system that makes it easy to manage dependencies.
